Project 1: Domain-Specific FAQ Chatbot with Knowledge Graph Integration
Overview
Traditional chatbots often rely solely on predefined responses or general-purpose AI models, leading to shallow answers that lack domain-specific depth. They struggle to understand complex relationships, hierarchies, and contextual dependencies within a specialized field. This results in inaccurate or incomplete responses, making them unreliable for industry-specific use cases.

Challenge
Develop a domain-specific FAQ chatbot that:

Integrates a knowledge graph for real-time contextual understanding.
Understands relationships, hierarchies, and dependencies within a domain.
Provides insightful, structured, and fact-enriched answers beyond standalone AI models.
Supports real-time updates as new knowledge is added to the graph.
Enhances responses with definitions, examples, and contextual references from structured data.
Key Features
Conversational AI + Knowledge Graph: Combines NLP (LLM) with structured data.
Context-Aware Answers: Leverages relationships and hierarchies for deeper insights.
Real-Time Data Access: Fetches the latest domain-specific facts dynamically.
Adaptive Learning: Updates the knowledge graph with new insights over time.
Multi-Format Support: Responds with text, images, links, and interactive elements.
Impact
This chatbot will transform industry-specific FAQs by providing more accurate, contextual, and enriched responses. It will enable businesses to automate complex queries, improve customer support, and enhance knowledge management through AI-powered intelligence.

Project 2: Mini-Recommendation System with MeTTa Knowledge Representation
Overview
This project aims to build a recommendation system that leverages the MeTTa programming language for knowledge representation and querying. By structuring movie data in MeTTa, we can capture relationships between genres, directors, user preferences, and viewing history more effectively. The system will provide reasoning for each recommendation, explaining why a movie was suggested based on structured knowledge rather than just statistical correlation

Challenge
Develop a mini-recommendation system that:

Uses MeTTa for structured knowledge representation of movies, genres, user preferences, and relationships.
Supports both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
Provides explanations for recommendations using knowledge querying functions.
Integrates Python for additional utilities such as data processing and user interaction.
Adapts to new user preferences dynamically by updating the knowledge base.
Key Features
MeTTa-Based Knowledge Graph: Represents movies, genres, actors, and user preferences in a structured way.
Content & Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on genre similarity or user preference patterns.
Explainable Recommendations: Justifies each recommendation by explaining relationships in the knowledge graph.
Python Integration: Uses Python to interface with MeTTa for efficient querying and result retrieval.
Dynamic Learning
Updates the knowledge base with user feedback and new movie data.

Notice & Requirements
Participants must adhere to the following guidelines:

Knowledge Representation in MeTTa: Structure movie data to capture meaningful relationships (e.g., genre, director, actors, user ratings).Define query functions to retrieve and infer recommendations.

MeTTa-Python Integration: Python must be used to interact with the MeTTa-based knowledge graph and process results. Use python mainly for user Interaction , such as APi …

Knowledge Querying & Relationship Extraction: Develop functions in MeTTa to extract meaningful insights for recommendations. Solutions demonstrating effective reasoning and explainability will receive additional points.

Impact
This recommendation system will enhance user trust and engagement by offering transparent and well-reasoned movie suggestions. This system explains why a movie is recommended, making it more interpretable and valuable for users.

Learning Outcomes
Designing knowledge-based recommendation systems with MeTTa.
Querying structured knowledge for recommendation logic.
Implementing Python-MeTTa integration for user Interaction.
Exploring content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

Project 5: FundMyChai – Web3 Crowdfunding for India’s Creators
Category: Social Impact / Creator Economy

Difficulty: Beginner – Intermediate

🧠 Core Idea:
A crypto-native crowdfunding platform for creators, indie hackers, or students. Contributors fund projects transparently, and every rupee raised is traceable. Create milestone-based fund release logic, so funds are unlocked only when progress is validated (on-chain or off-chain).

🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:
Smart Contracts: Solidity with milestone funding logic
Frontend: Next.js + Metamask / WalletConnect
Payments: ETH, MATIC, USDC support
Infra: Celo, Polygon, or Avalanche
🗃️ Data Sources:
Simulated creator projects (art, tech, music)
Sample donation amounts & milestones from Kickstarter, Ketto, Milaap
Optional: use WorldCoin or phone# proof to stop spam
🧩 Bonus Ideas:
NFT for donors (e.g., “Early Supporter”)
DAO governance to approve/dispute milestone completions
Desi flavor: Raise funds for gaushala, artist events, local causes

Project 6: RationChain – Public Distribution Tracker
Category: Public Good / Supply Chain / Transparency

Difficulty: Advanced

🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas:
Smart Contracts: Hardhat + Solidity for ledger entries
Geo-Verification: Chainlink Functions / Oracles for real-world inputs
Wallet Integration: Simple wallet-based ID for beneficiaries
Infra: Use low-cost chains like Polygon, Gnosis Chain
🗃️ Data Sources:
PDS/Ration distribution records (available in open gov datasets)
Delivery logs from logistics services (simulated or scraped)
Use mobile GPS + timestamps for delivery validation
🧩 Bonus Ideas:
Citizen grievance submission + dispute resolution on-chain
Dashboard for NGOs and volunteers to track supply gaps
Auto-generated public trust score for dealers based on on-chain activity.
